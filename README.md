# iMessage One-time-password (otp) Finder

If you use Safari on macOS, you've likely noticed that Safari will auto-fill OTP codes you receive via iMessage. If you use a different browser, you need to go find the code yourself and copy+paste it.

OtpFinder is a small app that watches the iMessage SQLite database for changes and checks for incoming OTP codes. If it finds one, it copies it to your clipboard.
