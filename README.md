# iMessage One-time-password (otp) Finder

If you use Safari on macOS, you've likely noticed that Safari will auto-fill OTP codes you receive via iMessage. If you use a different browser, you need to go find the code yourself and copy+paste it.

OtpFinder is a small app that periodically queries the iMessage SQLite database in search of OTP codes! If it finds one, it copies it to your clipboard and sends you a local notification.
